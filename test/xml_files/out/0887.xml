	This one is standalone since the values are
	pre-normalized in this document, except that
	one defaulted attribute is (re)defined internally
	and so is one normalized one.
    
        Similarly the entity refs are internal.  Unparsed
        entities and notations are not listed among the
        items that must not be externally declared in
        standalone documents, even though processors must
        in theory report their identifiers.
